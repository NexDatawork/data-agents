## Features

 - Display of reasoning
 - Simple Dashboard and Export
 - Seamless workflow set-up
 - Contextual intelligence
 - Chat-bot for refining the results

## Workflow

### Create an account
Sign up with your Gmail, Microsoft account or create a new one on the website.
### Upload your data
Choose the **Data Upload** menu and choose a csv file from your computer or drag and drop it in the menu.

### Specify what you expect from the result
In the windows below choose an **industry**, **topic** and **requirenments** for better results. You can add comments in a seperate window.

### Receive the analysed data
In the **Data brain** tab you can see the summary, insights and description of the data.

In the **Dashboard** tab you can see the the graphs of the graphs of some distributions as well as summary.

In the **Chat** tab you can ask the bot about the details of the data.

## Results

After the analysis is completed the results are received in two tabs: **Data Brain** and **Dashboard**.

### Data Brain
General overview of the data is presented as well as the methodology of approaching the dataset which involves:

 * determining missing values and erroneous values as well as analyzing columns
 * determining typical metrics and patterns according to the chosen requirenments
 * analyzing patterns, such as peak values, popular items and more
 * deriving insights from the data
 * creating recommendations

Afterwards, recommendations on possible aspects of the data are generated:
 * recommendations on dealing with missing values
 * recommendations on using trends and prominent items for your advantage
 * recommendations on what data to focus on

Finally, a conclusive overview of the data and statistical insights are presented, such as:
 * Number of total data points
 * Data quality
 * Variable types 
 * Distribution of numerical, categorical and temporal variables with specified columns


### Dashboard

Brief overview of the data with only the most important metrics and figures, such as:
 * file information
 * number of columns of each type (numerical, categorical and temporal)
 * data quality and statistical summary

Brief overview is followed by analysis summary with a rundown of trends needed to derive conclusions from the data based on the user requirenments and recommendations. 

Finally, graphs of the most important variables are presented.
