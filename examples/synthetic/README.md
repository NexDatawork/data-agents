Relevant:

    notebooks/ (run notebook here)

    dpd_sample.csv (input template)

    output/ (generated files)

    synthetic generator code inside the notebook



Run

    Put dpd_sample.csv (any input csv) in the project root (same level as output/).

    Open and run the notebook in notebooks/ (remember to change the sample_path).
    
    The output's column is the same as the input sample's.

    The output synthetic dataset mimics the input's trend and statistical features (to be implemented).
    
    Choose any row numbers (any size of the dataset) for the output.


Output

    Synthetic CSV is saved to: output/dpd_out.csv


Paths used in code

    Input: data/sample/dpd_sample.csv

    Output: output/dpd_out.csv
